// Vitest configuration for opencode-smart-router.
// - Tests live in the top-level `test/` directory (NEVER under `src/`), so the
//   published package (files: ["src/", ...]) can never ship tests (plan C4).
// - The default run excludes `test/smoke/**`: those are opt-in real-OpenCode
//   smokes gated behind RUN_OC_SMOKE=1 (run via `npm run smoke`).
// - Coverage source is `src/`. Thresholds are enforced whenever coverage is
//   collected (via `pnpm run test:coverage` or `pnpm run test:gate`). The
//   default `pnpm test` deliberately does NOT collect coverage so the local
//   iteration loop stays fast; the merge contract is `pnpm run test:gate`
//   (and `prepublishOnly` chains it).
