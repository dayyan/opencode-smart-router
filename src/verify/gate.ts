/**
 * src/verify/gate.ts — Layer 2 acceptance gate (PURE orchestration core).
 *
 * The gate is the single decision point that turns "the producer says it
 * finished" into "the producer's output was objectively accepted". It is
 * shared by BOTH usage modes (Mode A on-the-fly dispatch and Mode B plan
 * annotation) and by BOTH wirings (Option (i) verify-dispatch around the
 * built-in `task` tool, and Option (ii) the plugin-owned `delegate` tool),
 * so there is exactly ONE accept/verify code path (GA-5).
 *
 * Design invariants:
 *  - FAIL-CLOSED: a verification error never yields acceptance.
 *  - NEVER silently accept a non-trivial delegation that has no checkable DoD.
 *  - producer != grader and grader >= producer are enforced inside runChecker;
 *    the gate never grades anything itself.
 *  - PURE: all side-effecting work (exec/fs/grader dispatch) is injected via
 *    deps; this module imports no fs/network/SDK.
